# Tombola - The activity generator
This project was created as a part of a JavaScript Bootcamp. During one day, I had the opportunity to create a fullstack application. And this project right here is the result of 8 hours of coding. Tombola the activity generator uses an external API called the Bored API. All it does is to give you inspiration for what to do when you have no clue.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
Remember that the server also needs to be started for the app to work properly. (See more in the server folder on how to do that)
